## üí¨ Sample Questions & Answers

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

**Q:** What is EC2 and how does it work?  
**A:** EC2 provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. You can launch instances, choose AMIs, define instance types, and manage networking using VPC.

**Q:** What‚Äôs the difference between Spot, Reserved, and On-Demand instances?  
**A:**  
- **On-Demand:** Pay per use, flexible.  
- **Reserved:** Commit for 1‚Äì3 years, cheaper.  
- **Spot:** Bid for unused capacity, cost-effective but can be interrupted.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

**Q:** How do you make an S3 bucket public?  
**A:** Disable block public access, set a bucket policy allowing `s3:GetObject` permission for `Principal: *`.

**Q:** What are S3 storage classes?  
**A:** Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, Standard-IA, One Zone-IA, Glacier, and Deep Archive ‚Äî each with different pricing and retrieval times.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**

**Q:** What is a VPC and its components?  
**A:** A logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you define your own IP range, subnets, route tables, internet gateways, and security groups.

**Q:** Difference between Security Group and NACL?  
**A:**  
- **Security Group:** Stateful, applied to EC2 instances.  
- **NACL:** Stateless, applied at subnet level.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ EFS (Elastic File System)**

**Q:** How is EFS different from EBS?  
**A:**  
- **EFS:** Network file system (shared storage, auto-scalable).  
- **EBS:** Block storage attached to a single EC2 instance.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ CI/CD on AWS**

**Q:** How do you implement a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and AWS?  
**A:**  
- Jenkins triggers a build on Git push.  
- Artifacts are deployed to S3 or EC2 using AWS CLI.  
- Optionally integrate with CodeDeploy or Terraform for automation.
